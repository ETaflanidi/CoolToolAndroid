CoolToolAndroid
===============
This library presents a UI verifying tool for Android applications.
This tool reveals on a specific gesture and helps to detect differences between design mock-ups and real application. 
The library could be embedded into an existing application project during development and it could be useful for QA/UI/UX engineers and project managers.

This is actually an Android port of existing CoolTooliOS project.
